These questions will help you improve your object-oriented design skills. You will get to learn how to analyze the components of a system in terms of objects and how to design a system using OOP concepts. You will learn how to organize those objects and make them communicate efficiently while keeping them flexible. It will be fun to learn how to design a flexible, reusable, extendable, and maintainable system.
